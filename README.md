# Drewl Meta Preview

The Drewl Meta Preview plugin will display how your content (post or page) will show on different social sharing platforms.

## Prerequisites

This plugin uses Meta tags (OG tags), so to be able to properly work it will need a tier plugin that will generate these Meta tags or you can manually specify them in your theme's header template.

## Installation

There are 2 ways to install the plugin: 

* Download the .zip file from the [Wordpress Plugin database](https://wordpress.org/plugins/drewl-meta-preview/) (recommended) 
* Clone this GitHub repository.

### Cloning the GitHub repository

cd wordpress-serp-preview-plugin
```

## Usage
